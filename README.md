# drum-kit
A 7-piece drum kit controlled by click, or by keys.

Uses event listeners, assigned to buttons, to tell when something's been clicked, or if the appropriate key has been pressed.

Two functions are created. One that makes the style of the appropriate button appear pressed and then unpressed after a pause.
The second function makes the appropriate sound (drum or cymbal) that goes with the image that is paired with the button that is pressed.

These functions are then each called, and the appropriate button passed in, resulting in the sound and appearance we desire.
